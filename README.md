# Wait for jobs [![Build & Tests](https://github.com/yogeshlonkar/wait-for-jobs/actions/workflows/on-push.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yogeshlonkar/wait-for-jobs/actions/workflows/on-push.yaml)

Wait for the specified jobs in the same run to be complete successfully before proceeding, helpful to prestart the job.
This action is beneficial when depedee job has steps that can run/ finish before one of the depdencies is finished.

[**Without wait-for-jobs**][without-wait-for-jobs-run]

Without wait-for-jobs `Job 4` will wait for all job dependencies to be completed before starting even though some of the steps in `Job 4` can be comepleted
without `Job 3` 

[**With wait-for-jobs**][with-wait-for-jobs-run]

![with-wait-for-jobs](docs/with-wait-for-jobs.png)

With wait-for-jobs `Job 4` will start once `Job 1` and `Job 2` are completed. It will complete steps that don't require `Job 3`, after thoese steps it will wait for `Job 3` to complete.
Prestarting of `Job 4` reduces `Total duration` (not a Run time or Billable time) 

This action uses [GitHub API][jobs-for-a-workflow-run-attempt] to fetch latest status of jobs in current run, It also can use JSON artifacts from run to set output of the step to be used in next steps

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

This step requires below permissions, it is available by default to all the jobs but in case of shared workflows it might be necessary to set it

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
```

### Input

```yaml
- uses: yogeshlonkar/wait-for-jobs@v0
  with:
    # GitHub token to access actions API
    # required: true
    gh-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    # To ignore jobs that are skipped from given list of job dependencies
    # default: 'false'
    # required: false
    ignore-skipped: 'false'

    # Comma or newline separated list of names of job dependencies for this step, it must be `name:` property of job if set
    # required: true
    jobs: 'job1,job2,Job 3'

    # Comma separated list of JSON artifacts from (jobs in) this build that will be parse to set as output for this step
    # required: false
    outputs-from: 'job1_output.json,job2_output.json'

    # Instead of exact job name match check suffix or job names, useful in case of reusable workflows
    # default: 'false'
    # required: false
    suffix: 'true'

    # Interval in milliseconds between each check of dependencies completion
    # default: '2000'
    # required: false
    interval: '2500'

    # Maximum number of minutes to wait before giving up, step will fail with message providing remaining job names. Can't be more than 15
    # default: '5'
    # required: false
    ttl: '10'
```

### Output

This action has output named `outputs` which is JSON string generated by parsing provided JSON artifacts from (jobs in) this build. Make sure output file names and output names are unique for each job to avoid overwritting outputs

```yaml
- id: wait-for-jobs
  uses: yogeshlonkar/wait-for-jobs@v0
  with:
    gh-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    jobs: |
      job1
      Job two
      Job 3
    outputs-from: output1.json,output2.json
- run: |
    echo ${{ fromJSON(steps.wait-for-jobs.outputs.outputs).out1 }}
    echo ${{ fromJSON(steps.wait-for-jobs.outputs.outputs).out2 }}
```

### ⚠️ Billing duration

Waiting for jobs in a step/ action will increase Run time, Billable time. The purpose of this action is to reduce Duration of workflow by prestarting dependee jobs.
If the ttl is set more than 15 it will be overriden to 15 minutes. If depdencies requires more than 15 minutes to finish perhaps the dependee job steps should be split in separate jobs not prestart together
